# Chaptera Cloud single-host V0 deployment contract

Task: `CLOUD-DEPLOY-01`

This directory materializes the public-safe deployment shell for the first
Chaptera Cloud host. It deliberately does **not** pretend that the production
Rust server already exists in this repository.

## Boundary

The templates are consumers of these task contracts:

- `CLOUD-SERVER-RUNTIME-01`
- `CLOUD-SQLITE-V0-01`
- `CLOUD-MIGRATION-01`
- `CLOUD-AUTHN-01`
- `CLOUD-SECRETS-CONFIG-01`
- `CLOUD-EDGE-01`
- `CLOUD-ASYNC-RUNTIME-01`
- `CLOUD-BLOB-STORE-V0-01`
- `CLOUD-SOURCE-INGRESS-01`
- `CLOUD-BLOB-GC-01`
- `CLOUD-HOST-GOVERNOR-01`

Do not use these templates as evidence that those producers are implemented.

## Physical V0

```text
Internet
  |
  v
Caddy :443
  |
  v
127.0.0.1:8080 chaptera serve

chaptera.slice
  +-- chaptera-web.service
  +-- chaptera-worker.service

serve + worker
  +-- local-block SQLite
  +-- private S3-compatible object storage

worker
  +-- bounded spool
  +-- sandboxed raw-PUB child (no network, no storage credentials)
```

The application listener is private by bind address, not merely by firewall.

## 2 GiB starting envelope

These are deliberately provisional deployment defaults:

| cgroup | MemoryHigh | MemoryMax |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `chaptera.slice` | 1280 MiB | 1536 MiB |
| web child | 960 MiB | 1280 MiB |
| worker child | 384 MiB | 640 MiB |

The parent slice caps aggregate web + worker use. Exact production values are
measurement outputs, not architecture constants.

Heavy parse/export concurrency starts at **1**.

## Disk/state

Canonical SQLite state:

```text
/var/lib/chaptera/chaptera.sqlite
```

Disposable/reconcilable worker spill:

```text
/var/spool/chaptera/
```

Do not put SQLite WAL on a network filesystem. Do not put large parser/export
spill in `/run` tmpfs on a 2 GiB VM.

## Health

- `/live`: process/event-loop liveness only.
- `/ready`: safe normal admission; false during incompatible schema/config,
  required durable dependency failure, startup, or drain.
- Detailed dependency diagnostics belong in `chaptera doctor`, not public
  health output.

## Caddy

The example Caddyfile requires **Caddy 2.10.0 or newer** because its
`request_body max_size` guard is a v2.10+ directive. The task-owned edge
acceptance pins `caddy:2.10.2-alpine` so this deployment dependency is tested,
not implicit.

The example Caddyfile:

- terminates HTTPS outside Chaptera;
- proxies only to `127.0.0.1:8080`;
- uses a finite 8 MiB ordinary API body bound;
- uses a separate finite 256 MiB streamed-upload fallback bound;
- relies on Caddy's native WebSocket proxy support;
- rewrites the three X-Forwarded authority headers at the trusted ingress,
  rather than preserving client-supplied proxy chains.

`CLOUD-EDGE-01` adds a second, independent Rust boundary behind Caddy:
only configured immediate proxy peers may assert X-Forwarded metadata;
production non-health requests must arrive through that HTTPS edge; canonical
Host and Origin are exact-match; browser mutations require same-origin plus a
bounded CSRF token precondition; transfer-encoded bodies are rejected and
declared body/header/time limits are bounded; responses carry CSP/HSTS,
nosniff, referrer and permissions headers. Route-owned authentication remains
responsible for verifying the supplied CSRF token against the authenticated
session rather than treating header presence as authorization.

## Raw PUB

The general worker may have object-store network access. The raw PUB parser
child must not inherit object-store credentials or network authority.

Conceptually:

```text
worker -> exact authorized object -> bounded file/fd -> sandboxed parser child
```

## Deploy transaction

The normal application-artifact install path is:

```sh
sudo ./chaptera install --config /etc/chaptera/chaptera.toml
sudo systemctl enable --now chaptera.target
```

The installer validates the typed config before changing `current`, copies the
exact running executable to
`/opt/chaptera/releases/<build-id>/chaptera`, materializes the canonical
systemd/tmpfiles/sysusers policy and embedded isolation harness, records the
previous release, then atomically switches `/opt/chaptera/current`.

For CI and package acceptance the same operation can target an isolated root:

```sh
./chaptera install --config ./chaptera.toml --root /tmp/chaptera-root
```

This staging mode never calls the host systemd tools. Real-host installation
fails closed when systemd is not active.

Schema compatibility, migrations, readiness and external Caddy remain separate
operator gates. Never overwrite the running binary in place.

## Drain

Web SIGTERM:

1. readiness false;
2. stop new expensive and semantic admission;
3. resolve any in-flight durable append;
4. stop new authority activation;
5. close/reject realtime sessions according to protocol;
6. passivate/release without a checkpoint storm;
7. exit inside the bounded stop deadline.

Worker SIGTERM:

1. stop new claims;
2. complete only at a defined safe barrier;
3. otherwise leave/release a reclaimable lease;
4. never turn ambiguous publication into success;
5. exit.

## Rollback

Rollback is only a binary/symlink operation while the durable schema remains
inside the declared backward-compatibility window. If migration crossed that
boundary, use the migration/recovery procedure instead of pretending that a
symlink reversal is safe.

## Acceptance

Final host closure must prove at least:

- direct external app-port access fails;
- HTTPS + WebSocket through the edge pass;
- incompatible schema produces not-ready;
- source upload -> quarantine -> validation -> durable binding -> project passes;
- ACKed edit survives web restart;
- killed worker lease is reclaimed without double publication;
- soft memory pressure sheds derived state before the hard parent limit;
- worker memory failure does not destroy web/durable truth;
- spool exhaustion rejects new heavy work while SQLite remains usable;
- SIGTERM during append produces a reconciled outcome;
- deliberately bad app release rolls back inside the compatibility window;
- normal logs contain no document payload, secret or signed URL.

## Public-safe status

This packet can land before the Rust runtime because it is a deployment
contract plus deterministic static validation. Do not mark `CLOUD-DEPLOY-01`
DONE until a real 2 GiB Linux acceptance host exercises the assembled runtime.
